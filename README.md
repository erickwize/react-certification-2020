Mini-Challenge 2: Intro to Testing

Answer the following questions first

- Using create-react-app, what do we need to set up for testing?

  Create-react-app includes jest and React Testing Library out-of-the-box, so it is possible to start writing and running the first tests right from the start without further set-up.

- What components are worth to test in your development?

  At this point the tests include all the components containing child elements that are rendered in the document and which provide information with which the user will be able to engage or interact (e.g. description paragraph, menu button, etc.).

- Can you apply TDD once you already created components?

  Even when some components have already been created it is possible to begin with the first iteration and first step of the TDD flow diagram: adding a test considering the acceptance requirements for the components. The result of the first test run may lead to a refactoring of the existing code continuing with the process flow for further iterations.
